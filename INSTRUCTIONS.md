# Instructions

If you'd like to follow along:

1. `$ git clone https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-ava-workshop.git`
2. `$ cd react-ava-workshop`
3. `$ git checkout start`
4. `$ npm install`

You'll notice that this repository is already (mostly) set up for a React project.
It's a bit contrived and doesn't actually amount to anything but a couple
disconnected components and a fairly worthless (non-flux) store.

You'll also notice that right next to each module, there's a `.test.js` file where
there's a single test that utilizes a module called `ava`.

We already have many of the same dependencies you would have in a normal react
project including `babel-core` and friends, `react` (and friends), and
`eslint`... and friends. However, to get our tests going, we're going to need
a few more dependencies:

🐯 *- Hi! I'm Terry the Tiger! These instructions are really long and boring! So*
*I'll pop up here and there where you'll be expected to actually do something!*
*And if you really want to skip around, just copy me and <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd>*
*(or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd> on windows) for me on the page. See you around!*

## AVA

Let's get this installed and going first. Until recently, AVA used our own babel
configuration found in our `.babelrc` for transpiling the test files. However,
that was changed in [this pr](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava/pull/398) and
now it no longer does this and instead has its own babel configuration.

Unfortunately, this means that we can't utilize `jsx` in our code test files!
A solution for has [been discussed](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava/issues/448)
and will (hopefully) be implemented soon. However, in the mean time. You'll have
to install an old version of `ava` if you want to use `jsx` in your test files.

🐯 To install the `ava` module, go ahead with:

```
npm install --save-dev ava@0.9.2
```

This will install it and add it to your `package.json` `devDependencies`.

Now we can add a `test` script which will utilize AVA to run the tests in our
`app/` directory with the filename ending in `.test.js`. 🐯 Add this to the
`scripts` object in your `package.json`.

```javascript
"test": "ava 'app/**/*.test.js' --verbose"
```

- `'app/**/*.test.js'` - a [glob](http://npm.im/glob) which matches our tests
- `--verbose` to get more information and preserve our `console.log`s

🐯 Now go ahead and run `npm run test`

> protip: `npm run test` `===` `npm test` `===` `npm t`

You should get output that looks like this:

```
  ✔ components › Toggle › empty test
  ✔ store › Customers › empty test
  ✔ containers › CustomerList › empty test

  3 tests passed
```

Great! Let's move on to our next dependency.

## nodemon

AVA [just landed](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava/issues/70) support for a
`watch` mode (similar to what `mocha` already has). However, because we're using
an older version of AVA for the time being, we'll have to implement it ourselves
to get the really nice `watch` functionality that's useful when doing
Test-Driven-Development. **NOTE** check
[this issue](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava/issues/448) issue to see if you
can use the latest version. If you can, you can skip this entire section and just
use the built-in `watch` functionality.

The `nodemon` module will work great for what we need. 🐯 You can simply install the
latest version (`1.8.1` at the time of this writing):

```
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

> protip: `npm install --save-dev` `===` `npm i -D`

Now, we'll add a new script which uses `nodemon` to watch the `app/` directory
and execute our `test` script whenever files change in that directory. 🐯 Add this
to the `scripts` object in your `package.json`.

```javascript
"watch:test": "nodemon --quiet --watch app --exec npm run test -s"
```

- `--quiet` -> to reduce the output in our terminal from `nodemon`
- `--watch app` -> respond to changes in the `app/` directory
- `--exec` -> run the following command when a relevant file has changed
- `-s` -> to reduce the output in our terminal from `npm`

🐯 Now if you run `npm run watch:test`, you should see the same output as before, but
the process wont exit. Now try to change one of the files in the `app/` directory
(add a newline) and the tests should re-run.

> protip: Install [`npm-quick-run`](http://npm.im/npm-quick-run) to type less :-)
>
> protip: Install [`npm-run`](http://npm.im/npm-run) while working with local npm-installed binaries

🐯 Now stop the process with <kbd>CTL</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd>

## nyc

The most popular and widely used tool for code coverage is `istanbul`.
Unfortunately `istanbul` doesn't support covering tests run in subprocesses. It
also doesn't support covering `ES6` code that's transpiled with `babel`. This is
the problem that `nyc` solves. It also has an incredibly slick API. 🐯 Let's go ahead
and install the latest version (`5.6.0` at the time of this writing):

```
npm install --save-dev nyc
```

🐯 Now let's add a script in the `scripts` of our `package.json` to record code
coverage:

```javascript
"cover": "nyc --reporter=lcov --reporter=text --reporter=html npm run test"
```

- `--reporter=lcov` - Commonly used format for code coverage tracking tools
- `--reporter=text` - To get the coverage output in our terminal
- `--reporter=html` - To get output as a static HTML page viewing with our browser
- `npm run test` - The script to execute to run the tests we want to cover

🐯 Let's run `npm run cover` now to see our coverage. You should see this output:

```
----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
File      |  % Stmts | % Branch |  % Funcs |  % Lines |Uncovered Lines |
----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
All files |      100 |      100 |      100 |      100 |                |
----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
```

This is great! Just kidding. We aren't importing any files to actually record code
coverage on yet, so we have 100% of nothing covered. We'll get there!

You'll also notice that running this command added two directories to our repo:

- `coverage/` - coverage report information
- `.nyc_output/` - `nyc` specific output (no idea what it's for honestly)

You'll want to make sure that you add these to your `.gitignore` file as they're
generated files and have no place in a version control system. I've already done
this for you. Just don't forget to do this in your own projects.

🐯 While we're here, let's add a `watch` mode for coverage just for kicks:

```
"watch:cover": "nodemon --quiet --watch app --exec npm run cover -s"
```

This looks pretty much the same as our `watch:test` we did earlier.

🐯 Finally, one other thing that we'll add to our scripts that's kind of handy from
`nyc` is the ability to validate a level of code coverage percentages:

```
"check-coverage": "nyc check-coverage --statements 100 --branches 100 --functions 100 --lines 100"
```

Each of these options defines a different category of coverage that's been
recorded and the `100` signifies that we want this command to fail if the coverage
report indicates a percentage of less than `100%` for that category. This can be
useful in validation scripts to ensure that the project is maintaining your goal
of coverage percentage. In a small project like this `100%` is a reasonable goal.
However, in your project, something more like `%70` or so may be more reasonable.

> [ghooks](http://npm.im/ghooks)

## babel-register

So far, we haven't actually tested anything. All of our tests are totally empty.
One thing that we're about to discover as we start importing our modules into our
tests is that AVA wont transpile them with `babel` for us. Let's see what I mean.
🐯 Go ahead and open the `Customers.test.js` file in the `app/store/` directory and
put this in it:

```javascript
import test from 'ava'
import store from './Customers'

test('empty test', t => t.pass())
```

🐯 Now try to run `npm run test` and you'll get output with this error message:

```
SyntaxError: Block-scoped declarations (let, const, function, class) not yet supported outside strict mode
```

We have to transpile on the fly by ourselves. Having this control over what
happens to our source code is actually quite nice (even if it means a bit more
work for us).

So we need to transpile this code on the fly using `babel-register`, 🐯 so let's go
ahead and install the latest version (`6.5.1` at the time of this writing) of
that now:

```
npm install --save-dev babel-register
```

With that, we now need to require that file in every one of our test files that
require code we want to transpile. Just kidding! That would be incredibly lame!
AVA has a flag (`--require`) that we can use to basically do this for us. However,
instead of just using `--require babel-register`, we're going to add a new file
to do this for us because we're going to add more environment setup code in there
soon.

🐯 So create a new file in the `other/` directory called `setup-ava-tests.js` and
place this in there:

```javascript
require('babel-register')
require('babel-polyfill') // this has already been installed. May as well :-)
```

🐯 Now, update the `test` script in the `scripts` object of your `package.json` to
use the `--require` flag like so:

```javascript
"test": "ava 'app/**/*.test.js' --verbose --require ./other/setup-ava-tests.js"
```

🐯 Now if you run the `npm run test` you should get this again:

```
  ✔ containers › CustomerList › empty test
  ✔ components › Toggle › empty test
  ✔ store › Customers › empty test

  3 tests passed
```

Awesome! 🎉 Unfortunately, there's one more thing we need to consider before we're
all set. 🐯 Try to run `npm run cover`. You'll get this output:

```
---------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
File                 |  % Stmts | % Branch |  % Funcs |  % Lines |Uncovered Lines |
---------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|

  Customers.js       |    46.15 |      100 |        0 |    46.15 |... 20,21,22,27 |
 other/              |      100 |      100 |      100 |      100 |                |
  setup-ava-tests.js |      100 |      100 |      100 |      100 |                |
---------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
All files            |    53.33 |      100 |        0 |    53.33 |                |
---------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
```

I'm not talking about the low coverage on the `Customers.js` file. We'll deal with
that later. I'm talking about the coverage being recorded on our `setup-ava-tests`
file. It's skewing our results, so we need to tell `nyc` to exclude it from the
results.

There are two ways we can exclude code from coverage. We can either utilize the
many methods available for ignoring code with `istanbul`
([learn more](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul/blob/master/ignoring-code-for-coverage.md)),
or we can configure `nyc` to exclude specific `glob`s. We'll do the later.

`nyc` configuration happens in the `package.json` file. 🐯 Add an `nyc` property to
the root of your `package.json` object:

```javascript
"nyc": {
  "exclude": [
    "other"
  ]
}
```

- `exclude` - an array of globs that should be excluded from coverage instrumentation

🐯 Now run `npm run cover` again and you'll see that the report excludes `other/`

```
---------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
File           |  % Stmts | % Branch |  % Funcs |  % Lines |Uncovered Lines |
---------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|

  Customers.js |    46.15 |      100 |        0 |    46.15 |... 20,21,22,27 |
---------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
All files      |    46.15 |      100 |        0 |    46.15 |                |
---------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
```

Like I said, we'll deal with the coverage numbers later. Like... right now!!!

## Test Customers.js

Now we can finally start writing some tests! This module has absolutely nothing to
do with React. It's just regular, vanilla JavaScript! That's the way we like it.
The more we can do that, the better!

There are three APIs exposed from `Customer.js` that we'll be wanting to test:

- `getCustomers`
- `setCustomers`
- `subscribe`

Each is documented using JSDoc. 🐯 Go ahead and copy this into the `Customer.test.js`
file and follow the instructions in the comments:

```javascript
import test from 'ava'
import sinon from 'sinon' // you'll need to install this with `npm install --save-dev sinon`
import store from './Customers'

test('customers should start with empty', t => {
  // call store.getCustomers and verify the result is empty
  t.fail() // remove this
})

test('setting customers and getting them', t => {
  // create two or more objects with a string property called `name`
  // call store.setCustomers with an array of these objects
  // call store.getCustomers
  // validate that what is returned has the proper length
  // validate that the contents are the same as the contents of the array you passed
  t.fail() // remove this
})

test('subscribing to the store', t => {
  // create a function spy with `sinon.spy()`
  // use that spy to subscribe to the store and assign the unsubscribe function
  // call store.setCustomers
  // validate that the spy was called once
  // reset the spy with `spy.reset()`
  // then call the unsubscribe function
  // validate that calling store.setCustomers again will not call the spy
  t.fail() // remove this
})

// add an afterEach here to reset the customers to an empty array
```

🐯 With that copied into the file, I recommend you run: `npm run watch:cover` to have
the tests run while you're updating the file. Now go ahead and implement! You
want to look at the comment by the [`sinon`](http://npm.im/sinon) import and the
comment at the bottom about adding an `afterEach`. Look up how to do that
[here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ava#before--after-hooks).

Once you're all done, your output should look like this:

```
  ✔ components › Toggle › empty test
  ✔ containers › CustomerList › empty test
  ✔ store › Customers › customers should start with empty
  ✔ store › Customers › setting customers and getting them
  ✔ store › Customers › subscribing to the store

  5 tests passed

😎 stellar!

## Test Toggle.js

Alright! Now we can finally get to testing some React code! As
[my slides](http://kcd.im/react-ava#/2/2) illustrate, React components have three
inputs that need to be considered when writing tests:

1. Props
2. User
3. Data

In `Toggle.js` we'll be concerned about the `Props` and `User` inputs. We'll cover
the `Data` input with `CustomerList`.

When testing a React component, it's extremely tempting to go down the path of
reimplementing the component in the test. Essentially validating that this div
has a child button which has these attributes and this text. This makes for a
pretty finicky test suit because anytime you want to refactor the code (not
actually make any changes visible) you have to update the tests.

Instead we strive to simply test the output itself. So we're going to use the
function `renderToStaticMarkup` from `react-dom/server` to take a React component
and render it into its pure HTML form. We'll then make assertions that the output
contains the pieces that we're looking for. This approach definitely comes with
trade-offs, but its pros outweigh its cons.

🐯 Go ahead and open `Toggle.test.js` in `app/components/` and paste this in:

```javascript
import test from 'ava'
import sinon from 'sinon' // you should have installed this in the last step

import React from 'react'
import {renderToStaticMarkup} from 'react-dom/server'

import Toggle from './Toggle'

test('toggle--off class applied by default', t => {
  // render <Toggle /> with renderToStaticMarkup and get the output
  // assert the the output string includes the text for the classname
  t.fail() // remove this
})

test('toggle--on class applied when initialToggledOn specified to true', t => {
  // render <Toggle /> with renderToStaticMarkup and get the output
  // assert the the output string includes the text for the classname
  t.fail() // remove this
})
```

Simple enough right? Once you have this working, your `npm run cover` output
should look like:

```
  ✔ containers › CustomerList › empty test
  ✔ store › Customers › customers should start with empty
  ✔ store › Customers › setting customers and getting them
  ✔ store › Customers › subscribing to the store
  ✔ components › Toggle › toggle--off class applied by default
  ✔ components › Toggle › toggle--on class applied when initialToggledOn specified to true

  6 tests passed

```

We're missing coverage on the `handleToggleClick` lines. So far, we've only tested
changing the `Props` input to our component. Now we need to simulate the `User`
input.

To do this, we'll leverage React's Synthetic Event system by using the official
[test utils](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html):
`react-addons-test-utils`. 🐯 Go ahead and install the latest version of this now
(`0.14.7` is the latest at the time of this writing):

```
npm install --save-dev react-addons-test-utils
```

With that installed, 🐯 go ahead and add this test to your `Toggle.test.js` file
(but don't implement it yet):

```javascript
test('invokes the onToggle prop when clicked', t => {
  // create a spy to pass in as the onToggle prop (you'll need to import sinon)
  // use document.createElement to create a div
  // render <Toggle /> with your onToggle prop into the div using `render` from `react-dom`
  // get a reference to the button using `div.querySelector`
  // Use `Simulate.click` from `react-addons-test-utils` to simulate a click event on the `button`
  // validate the div's `innerHTML` includes the right class
  // validate your onToggle spy was called (only once)
  // validate your onToggle spy was called with the right state (true/false)
  t.fail() // remove this
})
```

You'll notice that the instructions require the use of `document.createElement`
which requires a DOM. That's because when you're simulating the User inputs, you
need a DOM. Unfortunately, AVA does not officially support running in the browser
([it's on the roadmap](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava/issues/24), and
someone seemed to have success
[getting AVA to work with karma](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/13971)).
Luckily we have [jsdom](http://npm.im/jsdom) which works great for our use-case.
It just takes installing and getting set up for each of our tests. 🐯 Let's install
the latest version (`8.0.2` at the time of this writing).

```
npm install --save-dev jsdom
```

With that installed, now we need each one of our tests to have the global
environment set up with this (because most of our tests will need this). 🐯 So go
ahead and open the `setup-ava-tests.js` file in the `other/` directory and just
paste this in:

```javascript
/**
 * This is used to set up the environment that's needed for most
 * of the unit tests for the project which includes babel transpilation
 * with babel-register, polyfilling, and initializing the DOM with jsdom
 */
require('babel-register')
require('babel-polyfill')

global.document = require('jsdom').jsdom('<body></body>')
global.window = document.defaultView
global.navigator = window.navigator
```

Now, because we've configured AVA to `--require` this file, next time our tests
run, they'll have this environment set up for them and have access to the global
`document` for creating elements. Which is what you need to do now. Go! 🏁

Once you have your tests implemented, your `npm run cover` output should look
like this:


```
  ✔ containers › CustomerList › empty test
  ✔ store › Customers › customers should start with empty
  ✔ store › Customers › setting customers and getting them
  ✔ store › Customers › subscribing to the store
  ✔ components › Toggle › toggle--off class applied by default
  ✔ components › Toggle › toggle--on class applied when initialToggledOn specified to true
  ✔ components › Toggle › invokes the onToggle prop when clicked

🔥🔥🔥 awesome!

## Test CustomerList.js

So we've successfully tested the `Props` and `User` inputs. Now what do we do
about `Data` inputs? Well, more and more applications are using the concept of a
single state tree to manage their data and with abstractions like Redux, you don't
often have situations where you `setState` in your component directly based on
changes to data (an abstraction like `react-redux` does this for you). However,
there are situations where we do invoke `setState` in our components manually,
and for those situations we need to have a mechanism for triggering that.

The challenge with this is we often depend on
[singletons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) to store our data
and subscribe to changes. This makes testing difficult because we either need to
make a mechanism for resetting the store between tests, or we run the risk of
tests mucking with the sweet isolation of our tests that we enjoy from AVA.

There is a rather simple solution to this however, it's called `defaultProps` (or,
if you're using `createClass`, it's called `getDefaultProps`). Rather than just
importing a singleton store and using it directly, we specify it as a default prop
and use it from `this.props`. What's nice about this is it allows us to override
it for our tests.

If you look at the currently implementation of `CustomerList` in the
`app/containers` directory, you'll see that it is just using the imported store.
🐯 Your task is to update `CustomerList.js` component to use `defaultProps` instead
and reference the store via `props.store`.

🐯 Once you've finished that, paste this into the `CustomerList.test.js` file:

```javascript
import test from 'ava'
import sinon from 'sinon'

import React from 'react'
import {renderToStaticMarkup} from 'react-dom/server'
import {render, unmountComponentAtNode} from 'react-dom'

import CustomerList from './CustomerList'

test('Renders no customers and add button', t => {
  // normal props test. Use renderToStaticMarkup and test the output when you pass no props
  // verify that it includes 'no customers' and doesn't include 'list of customers'
  t.fail() // remove this
})

test('Renders customers and add button', t => {
  // Here's where we need to provide our stubbed store
  // create an object that has a getCustomers function
  // which is a spy that wraps a function that returns
  // an array of at least 2 customers (objects with a name string property)
  // then use renderToStaticMarkup to get the output
  // then assert that the output includes 'list of customers'
  // assert your output includes the names of each of your customers
  // assert that your output doesn't include 'no customers'
  t.fail() // remove this
})

test('Responds to store updates', t => {
  // this is where we're actually testing the callback to the subscription
  // the other two tests were pretty much just testing Props
  // this test covers the Data input

  // declare an uninitialized callback variable
  // declare a customers variable assigned to an empty array []
  // create a store with a getCustomers that's a function which returns customers
  // also add a subscribe function that accepts a cb that simply assigns your callback variable to the given cb
  // Create a div with document.createElement (as before)
  // render the CustomerList with your store stub prop into the div
  // reassign the customers to an array of at least two new customers (objects with a name property)
  // invoke the callback (which should be assigned by now)
  // get the innerHTML of the div and assert:
  // it includes 'list of customers'
  // it includes the names of each of your customers
  // it does not include 'no customers'
  t.fail() // remove this
})

test('unsubscribes when unmounted', t => {
  // do many of the same things as above by stubbing the store
  // this one needs to create a spy that will be returned by the stubbed subscribe method
  // You don't need to worry about changing customers or invoking the callback
  // still render it into a div
  // But then you can immediately unmount it by calling unmountComponentAtNode (from 'react-dom')
  // then assert that your unsubscribe spy was called
  t.fail() // remove this
})
```

You'll notice that in the last test, you have to use `document.createElement`.
Good thing we already set up the DOM in our `setup-ava-tests.js` so we can do
that! The reason we have to is the lifecycle hook `componentDidMount` does not run
when you use `renderToStaticMarkup` and that's where this component subscribes to
the store. Same goes for the unsubscription code in `componentWillUnmount`.

For this one, you might consider taking a brief glance at the solution if you get
stuck. An abstraction can really reduce the shared logic between these tests.

Once you've got everything passing, your output should look like this:

```
  ✔ store › Customers › customers should start with empty
  ✔ store › Customers › setting customers and getting them
  ✔ store › Customers › subscribing to the store
Warning: Each child in an array or iterator should have a unique "key" prop. Check the render method of `ListOfCustomers`. See https://fb.me/react-warning-keys for more information.
  ✔ components › Toggle › toggle--off class applied by default
  ✔ components › Toggle › toggle--on class applied when initialToggledOn specified to true
  ✔ components › Toggle › invokes the onToggle prop when clicked
  ✔ containers › CustomerList › Renders no customers and add button
  ✔ containers › CustomerList › Renders customers and add button
  ✔ containers › CustomerList › Responds to store updates
  ✔ containers › CustomerList › unsubscribes when unmounted

### Redux

You may be wondering, "how do I test components that use Redux?" Well, this repo
doesn't really show that, but it's because it's pretty much exactly how you do
a normal `Props` input test because if you're using `connect` from `react-redux`
then you simply `export` the component that you're wrapping in `connect` for
testing purposes, and just test that the same way you do other components with
`Props` inputs.

If you're not using `connect` and you're subscribing to it yourself, then you'll
simply treat it like the `Data` input test where you accept the store as a prop
and add an item in `defaultProps` for the actual store singleton.
